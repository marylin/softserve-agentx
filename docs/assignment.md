Hackathon Assignment: Build an SRE Incident Intake & Triage Agent
Create an SRE Agent that ingests incident/failure reports for our company e-commerce application, performs initial automated triage (by analyzing code and documentation), and routes the issue to the technical team via our ticketing workflow, with end-to-end notifications for both engineers and the original reporter.

---

Core E2E Flow
Submit the report via UI.
Agent triages on submit: extracts key details + produces an initial technical summary (using code/docs as available).
The agent creates a ticket in a ticketing system (Jira/Linear/Other).
Agent notifies the technical team (email and/or communicator).
When the ticket becomes resolved, the agent notifies the original reporter.

---

Minimum Requirements
Multimodal input: Accept at least text + one other modality (e.g., image/log file/video) and use a multimodal LLM.
Guardrails: Basic protection against prompt injection / malicious artifacts (safe tool use + input handling).
Observability: Logs/traces/metrics covering the main stages (ingest → triage → ticket → notify → resolved).
Integrations: Ticketing + email + communicator (real or mocked, but must be demoable).
E-commerce codebase: Use a medium/complex open-source repository for your e-commerce application.



Technical Requirements for Submission
To ensure consistent evaluation across all teams, each submission must meet the following technical requirements.

---

Required Repository Structure
Each repository must include the following files:

README.md — architecture overview, setup instructions, and project summary
AGENTS_USE.md — agent documentation, including use cases, implementation details, observability evidence, and safety measures
SCALING.md — explanation of how the application scales, including the team's assumptions and technical decisions
QUICKGUIDE.md — simple step-by-step instructions to run and test the application, ideally in the format: clone → copy .env.example → fill keys → docker compose up --build. OpenRouter support should be included if applicable
docker-compose.yml — mandatory; the entire application must run through Docker Compose and expose only the required ports
.env.example — all required environment variables, with placeholder values and comments
Dockerfile(s) — referenced by docker-compose.yml
LICENSE — the repository must be public and licensed under MIT

---

Docker Requirement
Docker Compose is mandatory for all submissions.

Although we do not need to run every application during evaluation, Docker is required because it:

ensures consistent and reproducible execution regardless of the technology stack
provides a safer, sandboxed environment for code review and validation
allows resource limits and network restrictions to be applied during evaluation if needed
gives the review team a standard structure across all projects

The project must build and run from a clean environment using:

docker compose up --build


No host-level dependencies should be required beyond Docker Compose.

---

Acceptable Implementation Scope
Participants may use mocked integrations where needed. This includes systems such as:

ticketing platforms
email systems
communication tools

Mocked components are acceptable if the end-to-end flow is clearly demoable.

---

Demo Video Requirements
Each submission must include a demo video that meets the following requirements:

Language: English
Maximum length: 3 minutes
Platform: YouTube
Required tag: #AgentXHackathon

The video should clearly demonstrate the value of the solution and show the main flow of the application.

---

Important Notes for Participants
Before submitting, make sure your project satisfies the following:

the repository is public
the repository includes an MIT License
the required files are present and complete
the application can be built and run using docker compose up --build
only necessary ports are exposed
all required environment variables are documented in .env.example
the demo video is published on YouTube and includes #AgentXHackathon

---

Why These Requirements Exist
These requirements are designed to make submissions:

easier to review
more consistent across teams
safer to evaluate
easier to understand without requiring full execution

For security and consistency reasons, we do not rely on running every application during review. However, we still require a standardized, runnable structure to ensure fairness and technical completeness.


Deliverables
Each team must submit the following by the deadline (see FAQ #1 in #faq for timezone details).

---

Solution Introduction
A brief text (2–3 paragraphs) introducing your solution, the problem it addresses, and your approach.

---

Demo Video
A publicly published YouTube video (maximum 3 minutes) demonstrating the full end-to-end flow of your agent:

submit → triage → ticket created → team notified → resolved → reporter notified

Tag it with #AgentXHackathon in the title or description.

---

Public Git Repository
A public Git repository licensed under MIT. The repo must include:

README.md — architecture overview, setup instructions, and project summary
AGENTS_USE.md — agent documentation: use cases, implementation details, observability evidence, and safety measures (reference: https://docs.anthropic.com/en/docs/agents-use-md)
SCALING.md — explanation of how the application scales, including assumptions and technical decisions
QUICKGUIDE.md — step-by-step instructions to run and test the application
docker-compose.yml — the application must run via Docker Compose
.env.example — all required environment variables with placeholders and comments
LICENSE — MIT

For full technical details on each file, see the Technical Requirements post in this channel.

---

Optional Extras
These are not required but are welcome and will be considered during evaluation:

Smarter routing or severity scoring
Deduplication of incidents
Runbook suggestions
Observability dashboards
Team-wide agent configuration (skills, cursor rules, AGENTS.md, sub-agents, etc.)

---
